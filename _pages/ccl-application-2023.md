## Motivation

My project idea is to:
 - research seventeenth and eighteenth century movement and gesture acting techniques relevant to opera
 - translate this research into a digital "pose / movement vocabulary", and . 
 
I will be primarily drawing on the work of Dr Dionysios Kyropoulos, his research project [Chironomia](https://twitter.com/chironomia) and his thesis
[Teaching acting to singers: harnessing historical techniques to empower modern performers](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6f64b917-9d6a-4cce-ba87-926599d94447).

## Qualifications

- Machine Learning / Computer Vision / Synthetic Data, with specific experience in 3D animated human avatars
- VR Development (Unity)
- 3D Content Generation (Blender, Quill VR)
- Interactive Installation / Performance (openFrameworks)
- Singing (Opera/Musical)
- 3D Printing and Fabrication
